# Code Explained

The main game code is in `flask/templates/game.html`. It refers to numerous helper code files in `flask/static/game_src`. Those helper files are organized roughly thematically, but due to the nature of Phaser3 it is hard to make the code fully modular. So code in some of the helper files refers to variables/attributes in other files.

# Scripts

`mapDistanceAnalysis.py` was used to generate the sequence of human goals and robot actions. It uses `flask/assets/map_distances.json`, which is generated by http://127.0.0.1:8194/get_room_connection_graph.
